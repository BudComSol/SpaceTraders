## UI-Updates

###  NextGen UI
<img style="float: right; padding-left: 25px;" src="screenshots/screenshot-nextgen-ui-login.png" width="30%">
We are currently working on a sleek and modern design to completely modernize the look and feel of the game by adding animations and haptics.
One of the target goals is to get rid of the tables and rewrite the templates with better class names and UIkit. This will also simplify mobile optimizations in the future.


<i>Currently, only the login is ready, while the user interface mostly falls back to Galaxy of Wars. To enable the new login theme, set your default theme to NextGen.</i>


### Brand new "Office"-Theme
<img style="float: right; padding-left: 25px;" src="screenshots/office-v1.png" width="30%">
Introducing a brand new design called "Office". This design is based on Teams to blend more fluidly into an office environment. By reducing visual clutter to a minimum and using a similiar styling, it is easier to play in public without other people noticing. It is still a work in progress as it is based on the old "Nova" theme which doesn't fully support all dependencies in buildings etc.
 

### Update of the "Galaxy of Wars"-Theme

<img style="float: right; padding-left: 25px;" src="screenshots/screenshot-gow.png" width="30%">

The "Galaxy of Wars" theme has been updated with a new background and some small UI changes to make it more modern and simple. In the future, this theme will be further improved, as it is has the most functionality.
 
### New login screen

The login screen has also received a minor makeover by adding the logo to the top by default and changing the background.
